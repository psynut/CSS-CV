      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="statement">While I have been coding and programming as early as 1986, I have established myself vocationally
        as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor. I started programming on Apple II's and IBM PC's as a kid - almost
        exclusively in BASIC. I did spend some time in the 1990's with Logo and HyperCard. While computers and
        technology remained an interest through my adolescence and young adulthood, more time was spent with
        vocational studies and pursuits. While working at Sound (a Seattle community health clinic), I have
        established and continue to maintain a successful private practice, Envision Therapies. Person centered
        work along with a strong understanding of computers and software has made for a healthy balance in my life.
        Poor software in the behavioral health industry inspired me to return to programming. I more recently
        developed skills in Unity and C#, as well as Java. Now, I'm building my web skills and reacquainting myself with HTML.</p>

        <h3>Pizza</h3>
        <p>As a Chicago native, the need to preserve the rite that is Pizza was strongly reenforced in my psyche. After moving to Seattle,
          where real pizza is hard to come by, I took on a mission of seeking on a pizza recipe that does justice to the true nature of the
          tasty dish. The key is the dough. While it is not Chicago-style deep dish, it is a pizza that is hearty and delicious.</p>
